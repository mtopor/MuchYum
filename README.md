Create, adapt and share recipes 

ablity to adapt recipe based on the amiunt of ingridirnts. for exammple, muffin recipe requires 350 frams of flour, while the customer has only 275 grams. it ajould be possibke to recalculate and give new ingridirnts proportions. 3 eggs instead of 4 -> 25% less ingridients 

modify recipes -> substitute flour with gluten free option, inxrease its amount. 

recipe versioning. for example. 1st vesrion of cake, second version is gluten free and third one has less sugar
